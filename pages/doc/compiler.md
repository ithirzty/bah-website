## Compiling a program
After installing the Bah compiler, you can compile a program using <code>bah ./myBahFile.bah</code> inside a terminal.
The Bah compiler comes bundled with [standard libraries](./std_libs).

#### Flags
- **-h** show help
- **-o** sets the output name of the file
- **-c** translate the file to C instead of compiling it
- **-v** shows the version of the compiler
- **-l** compiles the program as a library

For more help on the flags that can be passed to the compiler, do: <code>bah -h</code>.
